# TriJam-116
A game made in 3 hours for the TriJam

It's a simple 1 button game in which the player controls a ranger that got lost in the woods. 

Something is looking for him. It's poking out of the ground, trying to catch him. You have to get out of there before night fall.

The theme was: "Stay there, don't move." My interpretation is that whenever the player presses space to stop the ranger, those are the exact thoughts that go through his mind.

Itâ€™s not much, but enough for a game made in 170 minutes.
